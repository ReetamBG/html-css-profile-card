# HTML + CSS Profile Card

A simple responsive profile card built using semantic HTML and CSS. It includes a profile image, name, bio, and social links.

## Features
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Centered card layout using Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Includes GitHub and LinkedIn links
- Uses Font Awesome for social icons (`css/all.min.css`)

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser.  
- If the styles and icons donâ€™t load when opened directly, try using a local server (e.g. VS Code Live Server). Some issues with the relative local paths that I could not fix at the moment.


## To Improve
- Relative paths may not work properly if you double-click `index.html` to directly open in browser, so maybe fix that first
- Host the icon pack from CDN instead of relying on local CSS file
